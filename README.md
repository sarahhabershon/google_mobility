Data note on "Baseline"

The data shows how visitors to (or time spent in) categorised places change compared to our baseline days. A baseline day represents a normal value for that day of the week. The baseline day is the median value from the five‑week period 3 Jan – 6 Feb 2020.

For each region-category, the baseline isn’t a single value – it’s seven individual values. The same number of visitors on two different days of the week result in different percentage changes. So we recommend the following:

Don’t infer that larger changes mean more visitors or that smaller changes mean less visitors.
Avoid comparing day-to-day changes. Especially weekends with weekdays.

How did we pick perfectly normal baseline days? We probably haven’t – a short period of the year can't represent normal for every region on our planet. We picked a recent period, before widespread disruption as communities responded to COVID-19. Even so, for some regions, the baseline falls during a time when COVID-19 was established. To interpret the data for your region, follow the local checklist.
To help you track week-to-week changes, the baseline days never change. These baseline days also don't account for seasonality. For example, visitors to parks typically increase as the weather improves.

Transit stations -- Mobility trends for places like public transport hubs such as subway, bus, and train stations.

Idea 1 - how did the way we live change? Why do we use public transport so much less? What happened to those journeys?

Idea 2 - did lockdown adherence wane over time?

- they do a lot of sliders


- align them by the last full lockdown?
- animate two views of the same data?

- isolate transit (or transit and workplace?) and do for all countries, then and now, slope chart
- look at laying years on top of each other
- look at weekday/weekend - "As can be seen by the split between weekend and weekday activities in Section 1.1, weekday traffic has not returned to pre-pandemic levels in the way that weekend travel has. This is, in large part, due to the continued prevalence of home working which impacts on both the commute and business travel." - https://www.creds.ac.uk/publications/less-is-more-changing-travel-in-a-post-pandemic-society/#:~:text=The%20overall%20weekend%20traffic%20levels,pandemic%20level%20by%20Summer%202021.
